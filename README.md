My personal website, written in Javascript, HTML, CSS using Node, React, SCSS, Webpack and Babel.

Yet another redesign after many, the site is permanently stuck in limbo as I don't have as much time to work on it as I would like.

## Roadmap
Plans to add are:

 - ~~Favicon~~
 - Short Blog Page
 - Featured Video (Code is ready, video needs to be made)
 - More Social integration and show off my social pages
 - Faster loading (SVG Backgrounds are quite large)
 - ~~Responsive Image Loading~~
 - Async Image/Video loading for content (no point just yet)
 - ~~Async page offsetting,~~ as well as proper loading templates
 - Improved SEO
 - Reduce Divitis
 - Restore previously removed page transitions
 - Convert some of the SVGs into responsive PNGs
