  <h2>Shopify Expert</h2>
  <p>
    I'm currently working full-time as a Technical Lead working with the
    Shopify Plus platform. I have been working with the platform
    every day for over 4 years, and enjoy working with it immensely.
  </p>

  <p>
    Working with Liquid, REST and GraphQL App Development and general
    Shopify consulting. I have had the privilage of working with countless
    Shopify Plus clients.
  </p>

  <p>
    Despite Shopify's reputation, I have been able to make it do tricks
    thought impossible. I find working with Shopify's unique quirks very
    rewarding, and continuously find ways to surprise everyone, including
    myself.

  <h2>Personal</h2>
  <p>
    I spend most of my spare time considering programming concepts, and
    take a very pragmatic approach to planning software development. I
    enjoy unpacking what programming itself means and entails to come up
    with new paradigms to use in my job.
  </p>

  <p>
    I also have an appreciation for the raw power of technology and making
    something beautiful and intricate out of the minimal amount of tools.
    Hence this website appearing so basic.
  </p>

  <p>
    I also enjoy video games and antique electronics. I still own four old
    CRT Monitors that I love and use as my primary video game displays.
