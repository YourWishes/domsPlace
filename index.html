  <h2>Programming Technical Lead</h2>
  <p>
    I am a programmer born and bred. Developing since I was old enough to
    type on a keyboard and continue to refine my skills more and more 
    every day. Backed by 14 years of experience and countless lines of code
    committed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Background with more anagrams than a bureaucrat, here are some of the
    highlights only;
    <ul>
      <li>eCommerce ( Shopify, Magento, WooCommerce, neto )</li>
      <li>Traditional Web ( HTML, CSS, JS )</li>
      <li>Modern Web ( ES6, TS, GraphQL )</li>
      <li>Server Side ( NodeJS, PHP, .NET )</li>
      <li>Client Side ( C/C++, Java )</li>
      <li>Database Side ( SQL, NoSQL )</li>
      <li>Frameworks ( React, Web Components )</li>
      <li>Antiques ( Lua, jQuery, SOAPXML )</li>
      <li>Flashy ( OpenGL, Vulkan, Unity )</li>
      <li>Boring ( Google Data Studio )</li>
      <li>Servers ( AWS, CloudFlare, Heroku, Azure )</li>
      <li>Every "API"</li>
      <li>Ask me for a comprehensive list.</li>

  <h2>Shopify Expert</h2>
  <p>
    I'm currently working full-time as a Technical Lead working with the
    Shopify Plus platform. I have been working with the platform
    every day for over 4 years, and enjoy working with it immensely.
  </p>

  <p>
    Working with Liquid, REST and GraphQL App Development and general
    Shopify consulting. I have had the privilage of working with countless
    Shopify Plus clients.
  </p>

  <p>
    Despite Shopify's reputation, I have been able to make it do tricks
    thought impossible. I find working with Shopify's unique quirks very
    rewarding, and continuously find ways to surprise everyone, including
    myself.

  <h2>Personal</h2>
  <p>
    I spend most of my spare time considering programming concepts, and
    take a very pragmatic approach to planning software development. I
    enjoy unpacking what programming itself means and entails to come up
    with new paradigms to use in my job.
  </p>

  <p>
    I also have an appreciation for the raw power of technology and making
    something beautiful and intricate out of the minimal amount of tools.
    Hence this website appearing so basic.
  </p>

  <p>
    I also enjoy video games and antique electronics. I still own four old
    CRT Monitors that I love and use as my primary video game displays.
